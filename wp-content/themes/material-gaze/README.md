material-gaze
=============

A clean and minimal child theme for the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/themes/stargazer\">Stargazer</a> parent theme. This child theme takes inspiration from Google's Material Design to transform how it's parent theme looks.  It offers an alternative color scheme and comes packaged with additional headers to use with the WordPress custom header feature.

### Version 1.1.0

* Removed the custom background filter since this theme doesn't include any.
* added the borders back since it pushed the body down when a menu wasn't active.
